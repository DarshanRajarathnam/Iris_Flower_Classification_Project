This project explores machine learning techniques to classify Iris flowers into one of three species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris Flower Classification Project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation using the Iris dataset.

## Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification Project applies supervised learning methods to accurately predict the species of iris plants. This analysis provides insights into feature relationships and model performance metrics.

## Objectives

- To implement machine learning algorithms to classify iris species.
- To evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
- To visualize the data and the model results.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationship of features.
- **Preprocessing**: Implement preprocessing steps necessary for optimal model performance.
- **Model Building**: Apply various classification algorithms like Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate each model.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Provide insights from model outcomes and suggest improvements or further analyses.
